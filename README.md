# guess-my-number
Quick and fun guess the number game, choose a number between the value of 1 and 20 and see if you can retain a high score.

Javascript code-along to create parameters for selecting a certain number between 1-20.
A number is generated and stored as a variable which then needed validation if a number is not selected and if that number is lower or greater than the numeral range.
If and else statements are used to create Booleans but started refactoring code to make it easier and less repetitive.
